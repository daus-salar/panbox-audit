1. Decide the size of image in inches or cm (1 inch = 2,54 cm):
	For example 0,5 x 05 inch or 1,27 x 1,27 cm image
2. Knowing the Density buckets (120, 160, 240, 320, 480) compute the images size for each bucket as follows:

	For example, having 320 dpi density the resulting image will be: 320 px/inch * 0, 5 inch = 160 px

	Q:Need 1 cm x 1 cm image, what size in pixels it must have for 320 dpi?
	A: 	
		1 inch - 2,54 cm
		x inch - 1 cm
		x:1 = 1: 2,54
		x = 1/2,54 = 0,40 inch

		320 px/inch * 0,4 inch = 128 px

QR-Scanner image size:
		
	320 dpi => xhdpi -> double -> 1 dp * 2 px/dp = 2 px
	
	200 dp image width for 320 dpi is 400 px => 400 px / 320 px/inch = 1,25 inch => it is way to little, take two times more dp => 400 dp => 800 px / 320 px/inch = 2,5 inch = 6,35 cm

if you are experiencing problems with the theme of appcompat, then do the following steps to resolve the problem:




I did the following in Eclipse with the Android Support Library (L) project and the Main Project (M):

    Ensured both L and M had the same minSdkVerson and targetSdkVersion

    Added project L as a build dependency for project M by going into "Properties > Java Build Path" of Project M, selecting the "Projects" tab and adding Project L.

    In the properties of project M, under "Android", added a reference to L under library.

1 and 2 got the references to java classes working fine.... however I was still seeing the error in the Manifest xml for project M when trying to reference "@style/Theme.AppCompat.Light" from project L. This only went away when I performed step 3.
